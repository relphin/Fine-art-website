<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3>
The Tsyganenko long magnetospheric model (1987) has been used in 
conjunction with ultraviolet images taken by the Viking spacecraft to 
investigate the relationship of the auroral distribution to different 
magnetospheric regions. The model describes the large-scale structure 
of the magnetosphere reasonably well for dipole tilt angles near zero, 
but it appears to break down at higher tilt angles. Even so, a wide 
variety of auroral configurations can be accurately described by the 
model. It appears that the open-closed field line boundary is a poor 
indicator of auroral arc systems with the possible exception of 
high-latitude polar arcs. The auroral distribution typically called the 
'oval' maps to a region in the equatorial plane quite close to the 
earth and can be approximately located by mapping the model current 
density maximum from the equatorial plane into the ionosphere. Although 
the model may break down along the flanks of the magnetotail, the 
large-scale auroral distribution generally reflects variations in the 
near-earth region and can be modeled quite effectively. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Viking images obtained throughout 1986 have been utilized in 
combination with IMP 8 satellite measurements of the IMF to determine 
typical Northern Hemisphere auroral distributions for a variety of IMF 
Bz positive conditions. Varying By has an effect which is consistent 
with expected results; that is, By positive implies high-latitude 
auroral arcs in the dusk sector, while negative By gives dawn-sector 
polar arcs. A new result gives significant importance to the Bx 
component of the IMF. Bx toward the sun gives polar arcs on both dawn 
and dusk with comparatively weak UV emissions. With Bx away from the 
sun, a single sun-aligned morning-sector polar arc dominates the 
auroral distribution. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
&gt;From 32,000 forbidden O I 577 A airglow limb observations made 
between April 1971 and December 1972 from the ISIS-2 satellite, the 
major temporal and spatial night airglow features have been identified. 
Two methods of analysis were employed: harmonic fitting and global 
correlation. Airglow emission rate maxima occurred in mid-October and 
mid-April at all latitudes. The intensities peaked near 35 deg in the 
winter and near 25 deg in the summer, and showed a symmetry with 
latitude centered about 5 deg in the winter hemisphere. The mean 
intensity at mid-latitudes was 175 R, and near the equator was 120 R. 
&gt;From the global correlation analysis it was shown that there are 
two distinct contributions to the temporal and spatial airglow 
variations: one is from local production, which dominates during the 
post-solstice period, and the other is from large scale meridional 
transport, which dominates during the post-equinox period. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The departure of the aurora from quiet levels in a dynamic manner 
constitutes some type of auroral ``breakup'' event. Research into the 
auroral breakup predates the International Geophysical Year 
(1957/1958). This feature of the aurora, and the later, more global 
concept of the auroral substorm, has become a focus for much of the 
auroral research that occurs today. New instrumentation and global 
collaborations continue to refine our knowledge of the substorm process 
and how it proceeds in the ionosphere. In particular, global auroral 
imaging has advanced our understanding of the dynamics of the process 
and has given us the ability to put localized observations into a 
global perspective. Fundamentally new cycles of auroral activity are 
now understood to exist, and this has provided a means by which auroral 
activity can answer questions about magnetospheric substorm dynamics. 
Along with this wealth of observations has come a wide range of 
theories purporting to explain the mechanism of the onset of this 
phenomenon. There is, however, no single theory which stands out as 
clearly explaining the wide range of active auroral phenomena. A 
synthesis which combines these theories and allows them to each explain 
individual aspects of the problem appears to be required. This has led 
to a new way of understanding the active aurora as a set of processes 
or modules which occur either coupled together or independent of one 
another to form a particular event. This view represents a fundamental 
departure from the view of the substorm as a single unchanging entity. 
Auroral activity can rather be thought of as the earthward end of a 
diverse set of ionospheric and magnetospheric processes which couple 
together to form different cyclical patterns. A symbolic representation 
of this modularization is presented to simplify future schematics of 
large-scale auroral dynamics. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
We report the first global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of an 
actual magnetospheric substorm, which has recorded by the Viking 
spacecraft on October 19, 1986. The simulation is driven by IMP 8 solar 
wind parameters measured upstream of the Earth's bow shock. The 
substorm, which had expansion onset at 1132 UT, was caused by a brief 
period of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and two weak 
solar wind shocks. The simulation model includes a self-consistent 
auroral ionospheric conductance depending directly on the MHD 
magnetospheric plasma parameters and magnetic field. Synthetic auroral 
emissions, derived from simulation results, are compared to the Viking 
images, which show considerable dayside activity preceding the 
substorm. We also compare model-derived synthetic AU and AL indices to 
geomagnetic measurements. The simulation results are seen to be in 
resonable agreement with the observations throughout the growth phase 
and expansion onset. Moreover, the results allow us to form conclusions 
concerning which essential processes were responsible for the substorm 
occurrence. These results are a highly encouraging first step leading 
toward development of a space weather forecasting methodology based on 
the directly measured solar input. . <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Observations made with the Viking UV imager reveal that on the dayside 
of the auroral distribution there often occur emission features 
poleward of the normal continuous auroral distribution when the IMF is 
northward and in an away garden hose configuration. The position of 
these features, the strong IMF dependence, and the observation that 
large-scale polar arcs are seen to frequently connect to these dayside 
features suggest that these auroral emission features are the result of 
processes occurring on the front surface of the magnetotail. This is 
consistent with the discovery that these features seem to exist 
predominantly when the IMF B(y) component is positive, B(x) negative, 
and B(z) is northward, which implies that merging on the front surface 
of the magnetotail is involved in producing these emissions. Evidence 
is presented which distinctly links the location of merging lines due 
to dipole tilt and magnetic activity with the location of this 
high-latitude dayside features. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The CDAW-9 Event C focused upon the early part of 3 May 1986 when a 
large substorm onset occurred at 0111 UT. By modifying the Tsyganenko 
1989 magnetic field model, a model is constructed in which the 
near-earth current systems are enhanced with time to describe the 
observed development of the tail magnetic field during the growth 
phase. The cross-tail current intensity and the thickness of the 
current sheet are determined by comparison with three spacecraft in the 
near-earth tail. The location of the auroral bulge as recorded by the 
Viking imager is mapped to the equatorial current sheet. The degree of 
chaotization of the thermal electrons is estimated, and the 
consequences to the tail stability towards on tearing are discussed. It 
is concluded that the mapping of the brightening region in the auroral 
oval corresponds to the regions in the tail where the current sheet may 
be unstable towards ion tearing. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Views of the northern hemisphere auroral distribution obtained by the 
Viking satellite present a qualitative means of inferring the 
convective patterns which occur during IMF B(z) northward. The approach 
is taken whereby upward field-aligned currents are assumed to be 
coincident with large-scale discrete auroral features and on this basis 
possible convective patterns are deduced. While the patterns are not 
unique solutions, they are found to be consistent with merging theory 
predictions: for B(z) northward, the auroral observations support the 
possibility of three and/or four cell patterns. When the IMF azimuthal 
angle is 90 deg (270 deg), a clockwise (anticlockwise) cell is found to 
be located in the polar region between the two standard viscous cells. 
When IMF B(x) dominates and is in a toward orientation, convection 
stagnates, whereas if B(x) is negative, a four-cell pattern may form 
with sunward flow at very high latitudes. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
An intense geomagnetic substorm event on May 3, 1986, occurring toward 
the end of a strong storm period, is studied. The auroral electrojet 
indices and global imaging data from both the Northern and Southern 
Hemispheres clearly revealed the growth phase and expansion phase 
development for a substorm with an onset at 0111 UT. An ideally located 
constellation of four spacecraft allowed detailed observation of the 
substorm growth phase in the near-tail region. A realistic 
time-evolving magnetic field model provided a global representation of 
the field configuration throughout the growth and early expansion phase 
of the substorm. Evidence of a narrowly localized substorm onset region 
in the near-earth tail is found. This region spread rapidly eastward 
and poleward after the 0111 UT onset. The results are consistent with a 
model of late growth phase formation of a magnetic neutral line. This 
reconnection region caused plasma sheet current diversion before the 
substorm onset and eventually led to cross-tail current disruption at 
the time of the substorm onset. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The auroral distribution has several aspects which can be naturally 
related to magnetospheric processes. Dayside asymmetries in intensity 
and location of emissions enable one to visualize the implied 
convection and thus the geometry of dayside boundary regions. For B<sub>y</sub> 
&gt; 0 (B<sub>y</sub> &lt; 0) northern hemisphere polar arcs tend to be 
confined to the dusk (dawn) sector and the dusk (dawn) auroral 
distribution tends to lie poleward of the dawn (dusk) emissions near 
noon. These observations are consistent with the orientation of the 
convection throat and its dependence on IMF B<sub>y</sub>. High 
latitude dayside features, poleward of the particle cusp, are also 
dependent on B<sub>y</sub> and confirm that there is indeed a separate 
auroral system (and presumably current system) in the particle plasma 
mantle region (as defined by DMSP). The distribution of the auroras in 
the midnight sector during both quiet and disturbed times allows one to 
make important inferences about the mapping of these forms into the 
magnetotail. Fundamental to this is the observations of a continuous 
oval throughout the night sector, the location of substorm onset 
relative to this oval and the subsequent development of a ``double 
oval'' during substorm recovery. A unique set of observations are given 
illustrating how the different portions of the ``double oval'' develop 
during a substorm expansion phase. These observations support the view 
that on some occasions the expansion phase dominantly affects the 
central plasma sheet and leaves the inner and outer edges of the 
magnetotail relatively undisturbed. New observations concerning the 
dynamics of arc development westward of the auroral surge supports an 
hypothesis of Alfven waves modulating currents which in turn give rise 
to magnetic pulsations and multiple auroral arc systems. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The boundary between open and closed field lines is investigated in the 
empirical Tsyganenko (1987) magnetic field model. All field lines 
extending to distances beyond -70 R(E), the tailward velocity limit of 
the Tsyganenko model are defined as open, while all other field lines, 
which cross the equatorial plane earthward of -70 R(E) and are 
connected with the earth at both ends, are assumed closed. It is found 
that this boundary at the surface of the earth, identified as the polar 
cap boundary, can exhibit the arrowhead shape, pointed toward the sun, 
which is found in horse collar auroras. For increasing activity levels, 
the polar cap increases in area and becomes rounder, so that the 
arrowhead shape is less pronounced. The presence of a net B(y) 
component can also lead to considerable rounding of the open flux 
region. The arrowhead shape is found to be closely associated with the 
increase of B(z) from the midnight region to the flanks of the tail, 
consistent with a similar increase of the plasma sheet thickness. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Multi-instrument data sets from the ground and satellites at both low 
and high altitude have provided new results concerning substorm onset 
and its source region in the magnetosphere. Twenty-six out of 37 
substorm onset events showed evidence of azimuthally spaced auroral 
forms (AAFs) prior to the explosive poleward motion associated with 
optical substorm onset. AAFs can span 8 hours of local time prior to 
onset and generally propagate eastward in the morning sector. Onset 
itself is, however, more localized spanning only about 1 hour local 
time. AAF onset occur during time periods when the solar wind pressure 
is relatively high. AAFs brighten in conjunction with substorm onset 
leading to the conclusion that they are a growth phase activity 
casually related to substorm onset. Precursor activity associated with 
these AAFs is also seen near geosynchronous orbit altitude and examples 
show the relationship between the various instrumental definitions of 
substorm onset. The implied mode number (30 to 135) derived from this 
work is inconsistent with cavity mode resonances but is consistent with 
a modified flute/ballooning instability which requires azimuthal 
pressure gradients. The extended source region and the distance to the 
open-closed field line region constrain reconnection theory and local 
mechanisms for substorm onset. It is demonstrated that multiple onset 
substorms can exist for which localized dipolarizations and the Pi 2 
occur simultaneously with tail stretching existing elsewhere. These 
pseudobreakups can be initiated by auroral streamers which originate at 
the most poleward set of arc systems and drift to the more equatorward 
main UV oval. Observations are presented of these AAFs in conjunction 
with low- and high-altitutde particle and magnetic field data. These 
place the activations at the interface between dipolar and taillike 
field lines probably near the peak in the cross-tail current. These 
onsets are put in the context of a new scenario for substorm morphology 
which employs individual modules which operate independently or couple 
together. This allows particular substorm events to be more accurately 
described and investigated. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Several conclusions concerning the substorm onset region are made on 
the basis of auroral observations taken by the UV Viking imager. In 
particular, it is shown that the onset takes place in the poleward half 
of the region of intense diffuse precipitation. The observations are 
consistent with the conclusion that static magnetic field mapping 
places the quiet time auroral oval source region within 20 earth radii 
of the earth. It is also demonstrated that the large scale substorm 
surge is likely to be contained well within the closed field line 
region (with the possible exception of the eastwardmost arc system). <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Observations made by the Viking satellite have for the first time shown 
the development of multiple large-scale surge features. The longer time 
scale of these features is contrasted with smaller-scale vortex streets 
found along the poleward edge of the evening oval, which are generally 
observed to exist for less than 2 min. The ratio of wavelength to 
diameter in these features is shown to decrease with increasing 
wavelength. These observations support the view that the larger surge 
features are the result of Kelvin-Helmholtz-type instabilities, 
originating further out in the magnetosphere than their vortex-street 
counterparts. Observations of spiral features have been made at all 
local times, and the spirals always have a counterclockwise sense 
(viewed in the direction of the magnetic field in the Northern 
Hemisphere). One interpretation of these events is that they are the 
result of an exponential growth along a field line of an initial upward 
field-aligned-current perturbation. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
During the later stages of the auroral substorm the luminosity 
distribution frequently resembles a double oval, one oval lying 
poleward of the normal or main UV auroral oval. We interpret the double 
oval morphology as being due to the plasma sheet boundary layer 
becoming active in the later stages of the substorm process. If the 
disturbance engulfs the nightside low-latitude boundary layers, then 
the double oval configuration extends into the dayside ionospheric 
region. The main UV oval is associated with the inner portion of the 
central plasma sheet and can rapidly change its auroral character from 
being diffuse to discrete. This transition is associated with the 
substorm process and is fundamental to understanding the near-Earth 
character of substorm onset. On the other hand, the poleward arc system 
in the nightside ionosphere occurs adjacent to or near the open-closed 
field line boundary. This system activates at the end of the optical 
expansion phase and is a part of the recovery phase configuration in 
substorms where it occurs. These two source regions for nightside 
discrete auroral arcs are important in resolving the controversy 
concerning the mapping of arcs to the magnetosphere. The dayside 
extension of this double oval configuration is also investigated and 
shows particle signatures which differ considerably from those on the 
nightside giving clues to the magnetospheric source regions of the 
aurora in the two local time sectors. Near-Earth substorm onsets are 
shown to be coupled to processes occurring much further tailward and 
indicate the importance of understanding the temporal development of 
features within the double oval. Using 'variance images,' a new 
technqiue for the investigation of these dynamics is outlined. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The ionospheric electrodynamical state has been reconstructed for a 
transpolar arc event during northward interplanetary magnetic field 
conditions. An extensive set of observations by Viking and other 
satellites and by ground-based radars has been used to provide 
realistic model input data or to verify the modeling results. The 
resulting convection pattern is found to be consistent with the Viking 
electric field and intimately linked to the prevalent auroral 
distribution. It is characterized by a large evening cell, well 
extended across noon and split up by two separated potential minima, 
and a minor crescent-shaped morning cell. The convection signatures are 
found to vary a lot along the transpolar arc depending on the relative 
role of the arc-associated convection and the ambient convection. The 
transpolar arc is generally embedded in antisunward convective flow 
except near the connection points with the auroral oval, where sunward 
flow exists in localized regions. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Variations of OH rotational temperature and 557.7-nm atomic O intensity 
were measured from Calgary, Canada, from 1985 to 1987. Observations 
from three nights are discussed in detail, showing a correlation 
between the OH rotational temperature wave structure at 85 km and the 
green line emission at 95 km. This suggests that wave activity linked 
the two regions. At 85 km, high and low frequency wave structure was 
observed, but at 95 km the high frequency component disappeared. From 
temperature data from 16 nights of wave activity, horizontal 
wavelengths from about 5 to 100 km are derived and vertical wavelengths 
from 0.7 to 8 km are inferred. It is suggested that the dominant source 
of gravity waves in the mesopause region near Calgary is a result of 
prevailing westerly winds blosing over the Rocky Mountains to the 
southeast. No waves were observed propagating towards the southeast, 
suggesting the presence of a filtering mechanism. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
During two consecutive orbits of the Viking satellite on March 24, 
1986, UV observations of the Northern Hemisphere auroral distribution 
revealed rapid growth and decay of large-scale polar arcs. Evolution of 
these features occurred from the nightside auroral distribution toward 
the dayside. The connection on the dayside was short-lived (about 2 
min) and the arc retreated at similar speeds to its development (about 
5 km/s). Examples of arc occurrences during a half-hour time period 
show that arcs can extend from the nightside to the dayside and 
disappear, and another extended arc can appear at a widely separated 
position. These types of dynamic polar features appear consistent with 
the dynamic energization and precipitation of boundary layer electrons 
at high latitudes. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The spatial structure of dayside large-scale field-aligned current 
(FAC) systems is examined by using Viking and Defense Meteorological 
Satellite Program-F7 (DMSP-F7) data. We focus on four events in which 
the satellites simultaneously observed postnoon and prenoon three FAC 
systems: the region 2, the region 1, and the mantle (referred to as 
midday region O) systems, from equatorward to poleward. These events 
provide the most solid evidence to date that the midday region O system 
is a separate and unique FAC system, and is not an extension of the 
region 1 system from other local times. The events are examined 
comprehensively by making use of a mulit-instrumental data set, which 
includes magnetic field, particle flux, electric field, auroral UV 
image data from the satellites, and the Sondrestrom convection data. 
The results are summarized as follows: (1) Region 2 currents flow 
mostly in the central plasma sheet (CPS) precipitation region, often 
overlapping with the boundary plasma sheet (BPD) at their poleward 
edge. (2) The region 1 system is located in the core part of the 
auroral oval and is confined in a relatively narrow range in latitude 
which includes the convection reversal. The low-latitude boundary 
layer, possibly including the outer part of the plasma sheet, and the 
external cusp are the major source regions of dayside region 1 
currents. (2) Midday region O currents flow on open field lines and are 
collocated with the shear of antisunward convection flows with 
velocites decreasing poleward. On the basis of these results we support 
the view that both prenoon and postnoon current systems consist of the 
three-sheet structure when the disctortion ofthe convection pattern 
associated with interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B(sub Y) is small 
and both morningside and eveningside convection cells are 
crescent-shaped. We also propose that the midday region O and a part of 
the region 1 systems are closely coupled to the same source. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The poleward arc system of a double oval distribution is shown to 
activate at the end of the optical expansion phase signifying the 
beginning of substorm recovery. The velocity dispersed ion signature 
(VDIS) can exist coincident with this discrete aurora developing on the 
most poleward oval. Although the VDIS is usually associated with ion 
beams in the plasma sheet boundary layer, it is demonstrated that the 
ionospheric signature is not beamlike but distributed in pitch angle. 
At the time when the double oval begins to form, the magnetic field in 
the magnetotail lobe becomes less flared and can show Pc 5 period 
oscillations. Similar pulsations also exist in the ionosphere 
associated with the most poleward oval and with stationary surge 
formation. Theoretical considerations link this phenomenon with a wave 
source tailward of x(sub GSE) = -30R(sub E) and fast mode evanescent 
waves propagating earthward in the tail lobe region. In this case the 
magnetotail appears to act like a waveguide and the plasma sheet 
boundary layer as a resonance region. This implies that the coupling of 
this fast mode waves is with the plasma sheet boundary layer and not 
with dipolar like field lines. The implications of this for the 
reconnection model of substorms are discussed. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
A system of four current sheets of large-scale field-aligned currents 
(FACs) was discovered in the data set of simultaneous Viking and 
Defense Meteorological Satellire Program-F7 (DMSP-F7) crossing of the 
dayside high-latitude region. This paper reports four examples of this 
system that were observed in the prenoon sector. The flow polarities of 
FACs are upward, downward, upward, and downward, from equatorward to 
poleward. The lowest-latitude upward current is flowing mostly in the 
central plasma sheet (CPS) precipitation region, often overlapping with 
the boundary plasma sheet (BPS) at its poleward edge, andis interpreted 
as a region 2 current. The pair of downward and upward FACs in the 
middle of te structure are collocated with structured electron 
precipitation. The precipitation of high-energy (greater than 1 keV) 
electrons is more intense in the lower-latitude downward current sheet. 
The highest-latitude downward flowing current sheet is located in a 
weak, low-energy particle precipitation region, suggesting that this 
current is flowing on open field lines. Simulaneous observations in the 
postnoon local time sector reveal the standard three-sheet structure of 
FACs, sometimes described as region 2, region 1, and mantle (referred 
to the midday region O) currents. A high correlation was found between 
the occurrence of the four FAC sheet structure and negative 
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B(sub Y). We discuss the FAC 
structurein terms of three types of convection cells: the merging, 
viscous, andlobe cells. During strongly negative IMF B(sub Y), two 
convection reversals exist in the prenoon sector; one is inside the 
viscous cell, and the other is between the viscous cell and the lobe 
cell. This structure of convection flow is supported by the Viking 
electric field and auroral UV image data. Based on the convection 
pattern, the four FAC sheet structure is interpreted as the latitude 
overlap of midday and morning FAC systems. We suggest that the 
for-current sheet structure is common in a certain prenoon localtime 
sector during strongly negative IMF B(sub Y). <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The discovery of a new type of low-energy (less than 200 eV) plasma 
injection event near local noon several degrees equatorward of the cusp 
is reported. Its V-shaped energy-pitch angle pattern is very similar to 
that of impulsive or transient magnetosheath plasma injection events 
reported in the past. Thus, the source region of these injected 
particles is not a persistent one and it is likely of magnetosheath 
origin. The magnetic field and the electric field observations do not 
exhibit a strong electromagnetic coupling between the ionosphere and 
the source region. A high-energy (greater than 300 eV) population is 
absent, making the ion energy-time dispersion very weak. This event 
does not seem to be related to either any solar wind density increase 
or southward/disturbed interplanetary magnetic field conditions. It is 
suggested that this is a more stagnant phenomenon. <br>

A number of old concepts concerning the Viking auroral distribution are 
reexamined on the basis of the current understanding of the 
magnetosphere. Two new coordinate systems are described using 
magnetospheric magnetic field models which leave the aurora invariant 
under a much wider range of conditions than was previously possible.

magnetotail maps to a circular distribution if a centered dipole field 
is used in combination with the external field. The diameter of the 
main UV auroral oval can be linked directly to the strength and 
location of the peak in the cross-tail current distribution. Model 
calculations and observations indicate that the auroral distribution 
can have significant deviations from circularity even in corrected 
geomagnetic coordinates. The auroral distribution moves equatorward 
with increasing magnetic activity in response to an enhanced cross-tail 
current which moves eastward. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Satellite optical observations and particle measurements are combined 
here to provide an intercalibration between Viking UV observations of 
the dayside aurora and DMSP-F7 particle boundary definitions. The main 
auroral distribution is usually continuous through the noon sector 
between 8 and 16 MLT. There is generally good correspondence between 
the Viking UV aurora and the DMSP particle signatures. The mantle and 
cusp particle signatures from DMSP usually result in little if any 
Viking UV response and consistently appear poleward of the main auroral 
distribution. Magnetic field mapping indices that in addition to the 
observed DMSP particle cusps there may be a special cusp signature more 
closely related to magnetospheric topology. There sometimes appears to 
be a boundary between the mantle and polar rain particle signatures 
which is associated with a high-latitude auroral feature, poleward and 
parallel to the auroral 'oval'. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Optical emissions and electron flow patterns in the auroral oval 
evening sector have been investigated in the 30-min interval prior to a 
major auroral intensification. The STARE radar and Viking UV image data 
were combined to give a dynamical picture of the auroral ionosphere 
just to the west of the intensification region which was bordered on 
its eastward side by the foot of a high-latitude polar arc. Half an 
hour prior to the main intensification an auroral arc appeared 
equatorward of a band of eastward electrojet, which in turn was 
equatorward of another discrete arc system. The appearance of the new 
arc system was accompanied by a second eastward electrojet further 
equatorward. Within minutes of this appearance the older electrojet and 
arc system faded and the new system moved poleward to replace it. This 
precursor activity was followed by a major intensification, a substorm, 
to the east of the foot of the high-latitude polar arc. It is 
speculated that the precursor is linked to changes in the current 
distribution in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere prior to the 
substorm onset. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The increased probability of observing polar arcs during periods of 
northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) has tended to obscure 
their significance in terms of magnetospheric topology because of the 
presumed 'inactive' state of the magnetosphere. However, satellite 
imaging has shown that these high latitude features are quite dynamic 
both in their intensity and spatial variations. The overall morphology 
of the high latitude aurora has been described by a variety of 
imaginative terms, but its primary optical characteristic is of a polar 
arc(s) extending between the dayside and nightside auroral distribution 
on one or both of the dawn/dusk sides of the high latitude region. This 
large scale morphology is controlled by the azimuth angle of the IMF 
and the predominant configuration is one wherein the region between the 
polar arc and the normal auroral distribution is filled with low 
intensity diffuse emission. Simultaneous particle and electric field 
measurements show this region exhibits a closed field line character 
with predominantly sunward flowing plasma. These large scale polar arcs 
are connected (in either a diffuse or discrete fashion) to the 
nightside auroral distribution with essentially equal probabilities, 
but exhibit a clear peak near 12 MLT. This dayside connection is 
commonly associated with isolated high latitude features poleward of 
the normal auroral distribution which probably represent processes 
occurring on the front surface of the magnetotail poleward of the cusp. 
The existence of polar arcs is not always controlled by substorm 
activity: polar arcs can maintain their form and position well past 
expansion phase suggesting that they represent a fundamental boundary 
in the magnetosphere which is not modified by even large substorms. <br>

Hydroxyl rotational temperatures near 85 km altitude have been measured 
at Calgary, Canada in order to determine velocities, wavelengths, and 
periods associated with moving temperature structures. The velocity of 
moving patterns in two-dimensional data sets is used as a parameter for 
a global smoothing algorithm. It is found that velocities of the 
structures in the meridional direction were directed poleward, and that 
the corresponding Doppler bulk wind velocities measured near the 95 km 
height region were directed equatorward, suggesting the presence of 
filtering of internal gravity waves by the background wind. Two 
coherent wave structures were often detected simultaneously during a 
night. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
A simple model for the generation of poleward moving multiple auroral 
structures in the nightside ionosphere is described. The model is based 
upon the premise that field line resonance oscillations are responsible 
for auroral arc generation. The auroral structures are considered to be 
a result of interference between Alfven field line resonance 
oscillations on different L shells. Because of the dependence of the 
Alfven resonance frequency on L shell, any two neighboring L shells 
which oscillated initially with the same phase, after some time appear 
to be in opposite phase. That results in the appearance of 
counter-directed electric fields at these L shells and a large 
field-aligned current between them, which can produce the electron 
acceleration along the magnetic field and be responsible for auroral 
arc generation. The out of phasing between the oscillating L shells 
begins first at low latitudes and then propagates poleward producing 
poleward moving auroral arcs. The model requires that oscillations be 
maintained for many cycles of the waves and the source for energy is 
ultimately derived from magnetospheric convection in the plasma sheet. 
The field line resonance interference model explains periodic behavior 
in such auroral activity having frequencies in the Pc5 range. It is 
significant that the period of oscillation may be greater than that for 
the Alfven resonant oscillations, which implies that two separate 
frequencies may appear on the same field line. The poleward propagation 
of the auroral arcs in this model is a result of the poleward 
propagation of interference maxima rather than any real plasma or wave 
propagation. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Optical images of the auroral bulge as seen by the Viking UV imager 
were compared in several cases with the substorm current wedge (SCW) 
upward and downward field-aligned currents (FAC) whose positions were 
determined using the inversion algorithm based on the substorm-related 
magnetic variations observed at midlatitudes. With reasonable accuracy 
(better than 0.5 hours MLT) the estimated longitudes of the upward FAC 
generally pointed to the surge or to the brightest luminousity region 
in the western half of the bulge. The latter feature may imply a more 
complicated structure of the net FACs than can be described by the 
simple substorm current wedge scheme. Similarly, the estimated 
positions of the downward FAC pointed close to the eastern termination 
of the bulge. The associated optical signatures of this current system 
ranged from the well-defined emission depletion regions to new auroral 
intensifications. The downward current appears to correspond in some 
cases at least with the division between the morning sector portion of 
the double oval and the nightside portion connected more directly to 
the substorm bulge. The results in general confirm the expected 
association between the auroral bulge and the SCW, as well as showing a 
reasonably good results from the inversion algorithm based on 
midlatitude magnetic observations. Our results, however, also indicate 
that one must be careful in interpreting the apparent motion of 
SCW-related field-aligned currents inferred from midlatitude 
observations in terms of a true westward or eastward expansion of the 
SCW or of the auroral bulge. The observed changes may instead sometimes 
be related to the redistribution of the net FACs within than a shift or 
expansion of the simple current system. <br>

A method to determine whether a two-dimensional data set can be 
represented by two independent separable functions is demonstrated 
using both synthetic data and satellite observations of OI 5577 A 
airglow. For such cases when the functions are separable it is possible 
to identify the function in the presence of noise using an iterative 
procedure based on the properties of an equitable matrix. In the 
specific case of the airglow, the latitudinal and temporal variations 
are separable for the data set studied. The spatial structure shows a 
minimum near the equator, with maxima at 35 deg in the winter 
hemisphere and 25 deg in the summer hemisphere. The long-term temporal 
function shows maxima after the equinoxes, with minima near the 
solstice. A 12 month component has a maximum near day 300. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The time-dependent phase structure of Alfv? waves on open and closed 
field lines is studied. In accord with previous observations we find 
that Alfv? waves on near-Earth closed field lines exhibit a poleward 
phase motion unless they are close to the plasmapause, in which case 
the motion may be equatorward. Alfv? waves generated on tail-like 
closed or open field lines threading the plasma sheet boundary layer 
have received much less attention but may be shown to have an 
equatorward phase motion [Liu et al., 1995]. Phase mixing in the 
magnetotail proves to have a much richer behavior than that of 
near-Earth (dipole-like) closed field lines as not only the Alfv? 
frequency varies across the background field lines but the 
field-aligned wavenumber varies too. The two contributions tend to 
cancel each other partially for typical tail equilibria. Observations 
are given of a double oval configuration showing long-period pulsations 
on the poleward portion of this oval. Equatorward phase motion is 
observed and supports the theory presented here. These observations 
illustrate that Pc5 pulsation activity can be much richer than 
previously thought and can occur at locations not in the dipole-like 
region, as is usually supposed. The concepts presented in this paper 
provide a powerful framework with which to interpret observations 
related to auroral arcs, substorms, and magnetospheric equilibria. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Observations from the IMP-8 satellite of the IMF are compared with 
areas of the polar region bounded by the aurora as observed by the 
Viking spacecraft during quiet-time conditions (IMF Bz northward). A 
variety of energy-coupling functions are investigated and it is 
determined that the auroral distribution can be best described by the 
inclusion of azimuthal terms in addition to standard energy-coupling 
functions. The auroral distributions for Bz northward support 
antiparallel merging as a mechanism whereby energy is transferred to 
the magnetosphere from the solar wind. When the polar angle is small 
the region bounded by the auroras expands and may be controlled more by 
wave interaction at the magnetopause. Observations by the Viking 
spacecraft indicate a dominance of dusk sector polar arcs in the spring 
time and dawn sector arcs in the fall. Two alternative mechanisms can 
explain the observations. One involves the ordering of the IMF in a 
solar equatorial coordinate system while the other involves the sun's 
polarity and the traversal of the earth's orbit through different 
heliographic latitudes. A test is proposed whereby the two hypotheses 
can be investigated during the next solar cycle. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The relationship between auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) and 
discrete auroral features is studied with satellite observations. AKR 
generation is most often associated with nightside aurora, but under 
certain circumstances the source regions may also occur on discrete 
features identified as transpolar arcs. The wave spectrograms detected 
during crossings or closest approaches to such sources exhibit 
structures similar to those observed during nightside AKR source 
crossings. Also, the associated ion beams and trapped conical electron 
populations with enhanced upward directed loss cones peak at comparable 
energies. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
A substorm on July 24, 1986, exhibiting a rather unusual auroral 
morphology is analyzed with data from 10 spacecraft (Viking; DMSP F6 
and F7; GOES 5 and 6; three LANL geosynchronous satellites; CCE; and 
IMP 8). This substorm occurred during high solar wind dynamic pressure 
(&gt;5 nPa). Several notable features for this substorm are (1) the 
substorm onset activity was preceded by prominent auroral activations 
in the morning sector with spatial separations between adjacent bright 
regions ranging from ~160 to 640 km, and their intensity was modulated 
at ~3.2-min intervals; (2) the initial substorm activity was 
concentrated in the morning sector, followed by a sudden activation in 
the dusk sector, leaving the midnight sector relatively undisturbed, in 
sharp contrast to the traditional substorm development in which the 
major activity occurs in the midnight sector; (3) while a substorm 
injection was observed at a geocentric distance of ~8.4 R<sub>E</sub> 
by CCE in association with the substorm onset, particle injections 
(detectable with three LANL geosynchronous satellites) and 
dipolarization signatures (detectable by the two GOES satellites) were 
not observed until subsequent intensifications; (4) timing subsequent 
substorm intensifications from injections at the geosynchronous 
altitude differed from timing intensifications based on Viking auroral 
images by as much as ~3 min even when the auroral activity occurred in 
the same magnetic local time sector as the geosynchronous satellite; 
(5) the polar cap boundary was at a significantly higher latitude than 
the poleward boundary delineated by detectable auroral luminosity in 
the auroral oval, supporting the previous result that auroral activity 
at substorm onset occurs substantially equatorward of the boundary 
between open and closed magnetic field lines.&lt;p&gt;Detailed timing 
analysis suggests the substorm onset to be associated with southward 
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), with the crossing of an IMF sector 
boundary (interplanetary current sheet). The dimming of auroral 
luminosity in the midnight region was associated with a sudden 
northward turning of the IMF during high solar wind dynamic pressure 
condition. . <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Many different processes may take place at the magnetopause. To 
distinguish the various mechanisms requires simultaneous multipoint 
observations in the dayside magnetosphere. Such coincident observations 
were made by a number of spacecraft located in the solar wind, at the 
magnetopause, at geosynchronous orbit, and at polar orbit on September 
23, 1986. Beginning at 1110 UT, the B(sub z) component of the 
Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) underwent three periodic cycles, 
each with a duration of about 7 min, and there were 4 solar wind 
pressure pulses with a period of 10 min, as recorded by the 
Interplanetary Monitroing Platform (IMP) 8 satellite. The International 
Sun Earth Explorer (ISEE) satellite pair crossed the magnetopause near 
local noon at 1125 UT and recorded two bipolar events in the normal 
component of the magnetic field at 1115 and 1120 UT. In addition, ISEE 
1 observed a bipolar event at 1118 UT that ISEE 2 did not. Periodic 
oscillations and compressions of the magnetic field were then 
subsequently seen at geosynchronous orbit in the dawn sector. Greenland 
magnetometer stations also located in the morning sector recorded 
transient responses to the solar wind pressure pulses. The East Coast 
stations (near local noon) apparently observed a different vortex at 
1122 UT. Viking auroral images show an activation of a localized 
feature poleward of the dayside auroral distribution at 1122 UT. An 
auroral enhancement, seen at 1128 UT in the afternoon sector, moved 
eastward at a speed of 5 km/sec and decayed in intensity by 1141 UT. 
Clear Pc 5 pulsations were seen equatorward of this activation. 
Differences in both in situ measurements and ionospheric responses to 
the two bipolar events lead to the conclusion that the 1118 UT event 
can be interpreted as being associated with reconnection at the same 
time that the magnetopause was in motion. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The ultraviolet imager on board the Swedish Viking satellite was 
designed to provide real-time monitoring of the auroral distribution 
from space. This objective was achieved over the nominal lifetime of 
the satellite, March-December, 1986 during which period approximately 
45,000 auroral images were acquired. A number of technical and 
operational innovations have resulted in a rich data base for studies 
of auroral and magnetospheric processes. Some of the significant 
scientific advances that have resulted from the investigation of the 
temporal and spatial development of the auroral distribution include 
observations of rapid changes of dayside aurora, the effects of this 
distribution due to the interplanetary magnetic field, and more 
detailed knowledge of the substorm process. The utilization of models 
of the earth's magnetic field to map auroral signatures to the 
corresponding magnetospheric regions has led to an increased 
understanding of the mechanisms associated with the large-scale auroral 
distribution. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The response of the dayside auroral and electrodynamic processes to 
variations in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is examined with 
multi-instrument data from the Viking and DMSP-F7 satellites as well as 
ground magnetometer data. The event selected, which occurred on October 
5, 1986, was previously identified as a high-latitude dayside form by 
Murphree and Elphinstone [1988]. IMF B<sub>Y</sub> was positive during 
most of the Viking auroral UV observation, whereas IMF B<sub>Z</sub> 
made a transient southward excursion, followed by a sharp increase to 
+8nT. The results are summarized as follows: (1) There were two auroral 
belts extending westward from the early afternoon sector. The 
equatorward belt was persistent throughout the event and was embedded 
in the CPS/BPS precipitation region, whereas the poleward belt was in 
the open field line region and was associated with northward IMF B<sub>Z</sub>. 
(2) A new auroral spot emerged in the afternoon sector just poleward of 
the previously active region, delayed 10 min from the sudden increase 
in IMF B<sub>Z</sub>. This time lag is ascribed to the travel time of 
the new IMF orientation from the subsolar point to a solar 
wind-magnetosphere interaction site tailward of the dayside cusp, as 
well as to the response time of the dayside auroral acceleration 
process. (3) The new auroral activity expanded both eastward and 
westward during the first few minutes and then expanded primarily 
westward across the noon meridian, forming the poleward belt. The speed 
of the westward extension in the second phase was comparable to the 
speed of the ionospheric convection. (4) The dayside auroral process 
has a finite decay constant, which is inferred to be at least 10 min. 
(5) The response time of the midday ionospheric convection to IMF 
variations is estimated to be a few to several minutes. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Over the past few decades, several events of the intense growth phase 
preceding the expansion onset of substorms were reported. We reexamine 
these events using an extensive set of data, including ground-based 
magnetograms at auroral latitudes, solar wind data from the Wind and 
IMP 8 satellites, and auroral UV images from the Polar and Viking 
satellites. Magnetograms show that the intense auroral electrojet is 
located in the early morning sector during these events. A common 
feature among the corresponding solar wind conditions for these events 
is the existence of a period of southward interplanetary magnetic field 
(IMF) preceded by a prolonged northward IMF. This intense growth phase, 
however, seems to be independent of the IMF B<sub>y</sub> polarity. 
Enhanced auroras in the early morning sector appear during the growth 
phase. These auroras are consistent with relatively large geomagnetic 
disturbances during these events, indicating that enhanced 
conductances, combined with enhanced electric field caused by southward 
IMF, play an important role in the auroral electrojet during these 
intense growth-phase events. <br>

The positions of discrete auroral forms in the northern and southern 
polar caps are compared for four time intervals. UV Viking-satellite 
data were used for the northern polar cap, while all-sky-camera data 
from the Vostok station were used for the southern polar cap. It is 
shown that the discrete auroral forms can appear in the same time 
sector, can be located symmetricaly with respect to the midday/midnight 
line, or can appear only in one hemisphere. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The neutral line and boundary layer models to explain the triggering of 
substorms are discussed based on the EMF (Electromotive force) produced 
in the Low Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL) as consequence of massive 
solar wind plasma injection there. The hypothesis stems from recent 
observations that the dayside oval is persistently active while the 
nightside oval is only temporarily active. Region 1 current system is 
argued to be divisable into two partial current circuits. One circuit, 
entirely coupled to the LLBL, is related to the continuously active 
dayside oval in the cleft region. The other circuit, connected to the 
nightside oval and the tail current sheet, can be considered a 
diversion or a tail route for currents driven by the LLBL. The 
advantage with the current concept proposed is that it allows for both 
a driven and loading/inloading mechanism for substorms. Auroral break 
up is in this model a consequence of enhanced currents, induced by 
solar wind pressure variations within the LLBL dynamo, that has reached 
nightside magnetic field lines of enhanced ionospheric conductivity. 
The model also allows for the development of tail plasmoids, generally 
assumed to be the consequence of a current diversion instability within 
the nightside current wedge. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The Horn Valley Siltstone was subdivided into ten informal members, HV1 
(lowermost) to HV10, which reflect vertical lithofacies variations in a 
shallow marine shelf environment. The members were defined primarily 
from fully cored wells combined with gamma ray, sonic and density logs. 
Sedimentological and paleontological information, such as the presence 
or absence of body fossils, mode of preservation, species associations 
within groups of fossils, presence or absence of bioturbation (trace 
fossils), lithology, and bedding type, were also used. It can be 
inferred that the amount and composition of organic matter preserved in 
the sediment was determined largely by the concentration of oxygen in 
the bottom water and the extent to which the sediment was disrupted by 
burrowing organisms, because burrowing and scavenging activities of 
benthic organisms are controlled by the concentration of oxygen in the 
bottom water. Organic geochemical data from Tempe Vale 1 and Tent Hill 
1 were used to confirm these facies variations. The Horn Valley 
Siltstone was deposited during a transgressive-regressive episode and 
the organic-rich sediments, those with high TOC values (HV5, HV6, HV7), 
were buried rapidly. This allowed the exceptional preservation of 
organic matter and reduced its residence time in zones of bioturbation 
and oxic decomposition. This may have been linked to upwelling along 
the Central Ridge. The bioclastic limestone and dolomite interbedded 
with the bioturbated shale and siltstone (e.g., HV3, HV9) were probably 
deposited within well oxygenated and shallower shelf settings, and were 
moved by density currents into deeper water. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
The extent of palaeontological and biostratigraphic research undertaken 
during the most recent phase of Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) 
activity in the Amadeus Basin. Coordinated individual contributions are 
presented on the basis of the systematic palaeontological description 
and evaluation of the Late Proterozoic acritarchs, Early Cambrian 
inchofossils, Early Cambrian phosphatic and phosphatized macrofaunas, 
Late Cambrian and Early Orovician trilobites and condonts, and 
Ordovician and Devonian macro- and micro-vertebrates. As a result, 
biostratigraphic refinement of the Late Proterozoic-Early Cambrian Late 
Cambrian-Early Ordovician, and Middle-Late Devonian intervals was made 
possible, and represents a significant advance of knowledge. Refinement 
of the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician interval has led to the 
recognition of previously unknown stratigraphic breaks of consequence 
to event stratigraphy and to the development of palaeogeographic models 
which have a wider application in other Australian cratonic basins. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
One of the periods being studied is the interval 0000-1200 UT on May 3, 
1986, designated Event 9C. A well-defined substorm, starting at 0919 
UT, was imaged by both the Dynamics Explorer 1 (DE 1) 1 over the 
Southern Hemisphere and Viking over the Northern Hemisphere. The images 
from Viking, at 80-second time resolution, showed a surge-like feature 
forming at about 0952 UT at the poleward edge of the late evening 
sector of the oval. The feature remained relatively stationary until 
about 1000 UT when it seemed to start advancing westward. ISEE 1 and 2 
were closely conjugate to the surge as mapped from both the Defense 
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and Viking images. We conclude 
that the plasma sheet recovery was occasioned by the arrival at ISEE 
1,2 of a westward traveling wave of plasma sheet thickening, the wave 
itself being formed by westward progression of the substorm neutral 
line's tailward retreat. The westward traveling surge was the auroral 
manifestation of this nonuniform retreat of the neutral line. We 
suggest that the upward field aligned current measured by DMSP F7 above 
the surge head was driven by plasma velocity shear in the plasma sheet 
at the duskward kink in the retreating neutral line. By analogy with 
this observation we propose that the westward traveling surges and the 
current wedge field aligned currents that characterize the expanding 
auroral bulge during substorm expansive phase are manifestations of 
(and are driven by) velocity shear in the plasma sheet near the ends of 
the extending substorm neutral line. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
A substorm on May 4, 1986, midway through the PROMIS campaign of 
coordinated data acquisition, was uniquely well documented. Both in its 
aspects at earth and in its magnetotail aspects. The expansive phase 
onset was imaged by the Viking satellite at 20-second time resolution. 
Most of the expansive phase was also imaged by DE 1 at 6-minute time 
resolution. ISEE 1 and 2 were near the tail's axis 18.5 R sub e from 
earth operating at high data rate and data were recorded by several 
geosynchronous satellites. This multi-satellite study provides evidence 
that the active substorm aurora occurs at the feet of field lines that 
map to a magnetic X-line in the near tail. The longitudinal extension 
of the aurora during a substorm is associated with cross-rail 
lengthening of the near-earth neutral line. The concept of the poleward 
leap of the auroral electrojet (and the auroras) as the culminating 
feature of the expansive phase finds further support in these data. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Observations made with the UV Imager onboard the Viking satellite 
provide an ideal means whereby diverse data sets can be correlated 
together into the global context of magnetospheric processes. Substorm 
observations reveal the frequent occurrence on very short time scales 
(less than a minute) of extended arc brightenings during the early 
recovery phase of substorms. These brightenings are accompanied by the 
formation of multiple spirals due probably to instabilities operating 
along the field lines connecting the source region for the particles 
with the ionosphere. On the dayside, by comparing the UV observations 
with Interplanetary Magnetic Field data, it is found that during 
positive B(z) and away sector configurations, localized regions of 
emission can propagate either duskward or dawnward depending on the 
sign of B(v). In the context of current merging/reconnection theories, 
it seems plausible that these motions are the ionospheric signature of 
the drift of newly merged flux tubes. <br>

<h3 align="center"> Abstract</h3> 
Photometric observations of the airglow limb at 557.7 nm have been made 
from the ISIS 2 satellite since 1971. From an analysis of 32,000 
airglow limb observations obtained during the first two years of 
operation, the major temporal and spatial characteristics of the night 
airglow have been identified. Maxima occur in mid-October and mid-April 
at all latitudes. There is a marked variation with latitude during the 
equinox periods, with peak intensities near 35 degrees in autumn and 
near 25 degrees in spring. It is possible to gain considerable insight 
into the behavior of the lower thermosphere by combining the airglow 
observations with a simple model of the photochemical and dynamical 
processes. In this way a pattern of the latitude and temporal variation 
of atomic oxygen concentration at the peak of the layer as well as the 
eddy diffusion in this altitude region have been inferred. The 
concentration of atomic oxygen shows midlatitude peaks near equinox, 
and minima about one month after solstice. Average values at 
midlatitudes are about 1.3 times those at the equator. The amplitude of 
the semiannual component is about 20% of the mean value at 35 degrees 
as compared to 10% at the equator, and the amplitude of 12-month 
component is about 12% at 35 deg and 5% at the equator. The semiannual 
component has a minimum that occurs approximately 3 weeks (plus or 
minus) after solstice at all latitudes, while the 12-month component 
peaks in the summer hemisphere at solstice (plus or minus 2 months). <br>
