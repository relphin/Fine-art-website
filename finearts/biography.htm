<p><font size="4" face="Georgia">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rob Elphinstone grew up in
Calgary, Canada, and spent his youth travelling about the world. He went to Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation of the country acting as a photographer with "Doctors without Borders" (MSF). For months he wandered through the Hindu Kush mountains with the mujahedin experiencing first hand what it feels like to be under attack in a war.<br>
<a href="http://www.members.shaw.ca/afghanistanphotography/">(click here for
Photographs of this trip)</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He worked in space physics for many years, researching the Aurora Borealis (the Northern Lights) both from the ground and from satellites in space. He has authored more than 50 publications
<a href="paperswithabstracts.html">(Click here for references)</a> on the northern lights including review articles and has lectured extensively throughout the world. The beauty of the northern lights allowed some artistic interpretation to overlap into his scientific work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rob lives with his wife and two children in Nanaimo on Canada's west coast where they cherish the beautiful climate and scenery that inspire his paintings. He divides his time between being a stay-at-home dad and an artist.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p>&nbsp; <span style="color: #FF9933"><font size="4" face="Georgia">He specializes in capturing the beauty of the Canadian west coast  through his textured wild flowing landscapes.
  His art reflects the belief  that our senses reveal only a shadow of what we truly experience.</font></span><font face="Georgia" size="4"><span style="color: #FF9933">
  Rob believes that the beauty of a place is hardly ever replicated in a photo or a video.
  Our senses take in a fraction of what we perceive about the world. This tiny
  fraction is the shadow of what is really there. Good art should not have to be
  about what the inner psyche experiences or displaying perfectly what is
  optically there but should be about the unseen reality that everyone feels.
  Every one of his art pieces reflects the premise that creative art stems from
  what is truly evident&nbsp; in nature rather than the shadow that can be
  photographed. The term &quot;Actualism art&quot; is used to distinguish this
  art form from the emotionally based &quot;expressionism&quot; trend. Reality
  is more than just the sum our emotional impressions and the sense impressions of
  an external scene. The realism art discipline attempts to capture the latter
  and expressionism the former. Some Actualism art works from the belief that
  the only true art is the object itself. Rob Elphinstone's version of Actualist
  art allows that the observer can interpret the &quot;actual&quot; and create
  works that capture the essence of the observed in a fundamental way. True art
  captures the essence of reality rather than focusing on composition, technical
  prowess, or reproducing a precise scene.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of laying down textured
  brushstrokes helps capture the elusive nature so evident when we look outside.
  The textured brushstrokes give the paintings a unique look. This texture is
  laid down as a pastel underpainting which unifies my work and allows vibrant
  colour to be applied on top. This technique yields a complexity that mimics
  nature and that permeates every portion of the pieces he creates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>From a distance, the painting comes together through form as a coherent
  whole, but each portion catches the eye in a manner that draws the viewer into
  it.&nbsp;<br>

Actualism (1968)<br>
Term first employed by French writer ALAIN JOUFFREY to account for the effect of revolutionary situtations on art, for instance during the Paris riots in May 1968.<br>
During such events the division between art and social reality ceases to exist, and its significance or irrelevance is made manifest.<br>

The exhibition featured a wide variety of genres and techniques of the so-called
actualist art: painting, graphics, sculpture, application, objects,
installations, photography and much more, which create a parallel world
